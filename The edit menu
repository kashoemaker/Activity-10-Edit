##### Create the undo/redo lists

Create two lists as class attributes for your chessboard. The first list should be called undo_move and the other should be called redo_move.

##### Populate the redo list

Before a move is made, append the current board to the redo list.

##### Implement the Undo Button

When the undo button is clicked the current board should be switched to the last element of the undo list. This element should be removed and appended to the redo list.

##### Implement the Redo Button

When the redo button is clicked the current board should be switched to the last element of the redo list. This element should be removed and appended to the undo list.

##### Clear the redo list

Whenever a new move is made the redo list should be set to the empty list.
